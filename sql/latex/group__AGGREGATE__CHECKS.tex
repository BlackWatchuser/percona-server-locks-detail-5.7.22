\subsection{Detailed Description}
Checks for some semantic constraints on queries using G\+R\+O\+UP BY, or aggregate functions, or D\+I\+S\+T\+I\+N\+CT.

We call \char`\"{}aggregation\char`\"{} the operation of taking a group of rows and replacing it with a single row. There are three types of aggregation\+: D\+I\+S\+T\+I\+N\+CT, implicit grouping, explicit grouping.

This text describes My\+S\+QL\textquotesingle{}s checks (why certain queries are rejected) and the rationale behind them.

\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{group__AGGREGATE__CHECKS_DISTINCT}{}\subsection{D\+I\+S\+T\+I\+N\+CT}\label{group__AGGREGATE__CHECKS_DISTINCT}
D\+I\+S\+T\+I\+N\+CT\+: all identical rows in the result of S\+E\+L\+E\+CT are \char`\"{}aggregated\char`\"{} to one single row -\/ duplicates are eliminated. If the result of the S\+E\+L\+E\+CT without D\+I\+S\+T\+I\+N\+CT is \begin{DoxyVerb}1 2
3 4
1 2
\end{DoxyVerb}
 then the result with D\+I\+S\+T\+I\+N\+CT is \begin{DoxyVerb}1 2
3 4
\end{DoxyVerb}
 Here is a problematic query. Assume we have a table T which contains three columns C1,C2,C3 and has the following rows\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}C1 C2 C3
1  2  A
3  4  B
1  2  C
\end{DoxyVerb}
 and we do \char`\"{}\+S\+E\+L\+E\+C\+T D\+I\+S\+T\+I\+N\+C\+T C1, C2 F\+R\+O\+M T O\+R\+D\+E\+R B\+Y C3\char`\"{}. Because we want the result to be ordered, we have to first eliminate duplicates then order the result. When we eliminate duplicates, should we keep the first or the third row? This arbitrary choice will influence the retained value of C3, which will influence ordering. In the end, we have arbitrary ordering, which is problematic. To prevent this, if, in a query block \textquotesingle{}sl\textquotesingle{}, an O\+R\+D\+ER BY expression is not the same expression as one in the S\+E\+L\+E\+CT list of \textquotesingle{}sl\textquotesingle{} and contains a column which\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item is of a table whose qualifying query block is \textquotesingle{}sl\textquotesingle{}
\item and is not in the S\+E\+L\+E\+CT list of \textquotesingle{}sl\textquotesingle{}
\end{DoxyItemize}

then \textquotesingle{}sl\textquotesingle{} should not have D\+I\+S\+T\+I\+N\+CT. This rule makes the query above invalid. Class Check\+\_\+distinct implements this rule.

Class Check\+\_\+distinct implements a second rule, specific of set functions in O\+R\+D\+ER BY (a non-\/standard feature). Consider these queries labelled (1), (2), (3), with D\+I\+S\+T\+I\+N\+CT and a set function in O\+R\+D\+ER BY\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}SELECT DISTINCT MIN(C2) FROM T GROUP BY C1 ORDER BY MIN(C3);
SELECT DISTINCT MIN(C2) FROM T GROUP BY C1 ORDER BY MIN(C2);
SELECT DISTINCT C1, MIN(C2) FROM T GROUP BY C1 ORDER BY MIN(C3);
\end{DoxyVerb}
 (1) is a random-\/order query, (2) and (3) are not. My\+S\+QL has traditionally been permissive, we want to allow (2) and (3).

So the second rule is that Check\+\_\+distinct rejects a query if it has D\+I\+S\+T\+I\+N\+CT and a set function in O\+R\+D\+ER BY which is not the same expression as one in the S\+E\+L\+E\+CT list. This rejects (1) and allows (2). It would reject (3); luckily, before Check\+\_\+distinct checks, D\+I\+S\+T\+I\+N\+CT is removed (it is redundant with G\+R\+O\+UP BY) and thus the query is not processed by Check\+\_\+distinct; the second rule is thus by-\/passed and (3) is correctly accepted.

The implementation of Check\+\_\+distinct works like this\+: if the query has D\+I\+S\+T\+I\+N\+CT, examine each element of the O\+R\+D\+ER BY list\+: if the element is not the same expression as one in the S\+E\+L\+E\+CT list, then examine parts of the element (using \mbox{\hyperlink{classItem_ab7d2529511c14a77e59a1b1bbabc95d7}{Item\+::walk()}}), to spot offending set functions or columns.\hypertarget{group__AGGREGATE__CHECKS_IMPLICIT_GROUPING}{}\subsection{Implicit grouping}\label{group__AGGREGATE__CHECKS_IMPLICIT_GROUPING}
A query with set functions without G\+R\+O\+UP BY can be seen as having G\+R\+O\+UP B\+Y() i.\+e. the set of grouping expressions is empty, all rows are part of a single group and are replaced with a single row. So it is just a sub-\/case of the next section.\hypertarget{group__AGGREGATE__CHECKS_EXPLICIT_GROUPING}{}\subsection{Explicit grouping (\+G\+R\+O\+U\+P B\+Y)}\label{group__AGGREGATE__CHECKS_EXPLICIT_GROUPING}
My\+S\+QL is more permissive than the standard, it allows to group by any expression; it does not require that every element of the G\+R\+O\+UP BY clause should be a column of one table of the F\+R\+OM clause.

Here is a problematic query, using a table T with columns C1, C2, C3\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}C1 C2 C3
1  2  A
3  4  B
1  2  C

SELECT C1, C3 FROM T GROUP BY C1;
\end{DoxyVerb}
 we first form groups, in each group the value of C1 must be the same for all rows. Consider the group made of the first and third row. We have to produce one row out of it, and this row must have a value for C3 because C3 is in the S\+E\+L\+E\+CT list. Among those two rows, which value of C3 should we choose? This is arbitrary, and will give a random result.

To prevent this, in a query with G\+R\+O\+UP BY or aggregates (known as \char`\"{}a grouped
query\char`\"{}), any column referenced by an expression in the S\+E\+L\+E\+CT list or H\+A\+V\+I\+NG condition and belonging to one table of the F\+R\+OM clause, should be one of the group columns (enforced by only\+\_\+full\+\_\+group\+\_\+by in My\+S\+QL 5.\+6 and older) or, if functional dependencies are supported (as in My\+S\+QL 5.\+7), should be functionally dependent on the group columns. In the table T above, C3 is obviously not functionally dependent on \{C1,C2\}\+: the values of C1 and C2 for a row do not uniquely determine the value of C3. In other words, if two rows have the same value in C1 and the same value in C2 they do not necessarily have the same value in C3. So this rule correctly rejects the query above.

Note that N\+U\+LL is treated as one value\+: two N\+U\+L\+Ls are considered equal.

In WL\#2489, we have implemented the optional standard feature T301 \char`\"{}functional dependencies\char`\"{} almost entirely.

Here are the functional dependencies which we recognize.\hypertarget{group__AGGREGATE__CHECKS_KEYFD}{}\subsubsection{Key-\/based, in a base table}\label{group__AGGREGATE__CHECKS_KEYFD}
A key in this text is a unique constraint made of only non-\/N\+U\+L\+Lable columns. For example, a primary key. Considering a base table T, if two rows have the same values of all columns of a key of T they are actually one single row, so\+: \{ all columns of key\} -\/$>$ \{ T.$\ast$ \} (notation\+: what is on the right of the arrow is functionally dependent on what is on the left).\hypertarget{group__AGGREGATE__CHECKS_GCOLFD}{}\subsubsection{Generated-\/column-\/based, in a base table}\label{group__AGGREGATE__CHECKS_GCOLFD}
Considering a base table T, a generated column is functionally dependent on the set of columns it references (the so-\/called parametric columns). Note that the S\+QL standard doesn\textquotesingle{}t allow a parametric column to be a generated column, but My\+S\+QL does.\hypertarget{group__AGGREGATE__CHECKS_INNEREQ}{}\subsubsection{Equality-\/based, in the result of an inner join}\label{group__AGGREGATE__CHECKS_INNEREQ}
Considering two tables T1 and T2, a condition C, and the result R of an inner join T1 \mbox{\hyperlink{classJOIN}{J\+O\+IN}} T2 ON C. Note that T1/T2 are not necessarily base tables. For example, they can also be views, or derived tables, or the results of some joins; in the rest of text, we use the vague term \char`\"{}table\char`\"{} for those various objects.

Note that C may only refer to columns of T1 or T2 (outer references are forbidden by My\+S\+QL in join conditions).

Assuming that C is a conjunction (i.\+e. is made of one or more conditions, \char`\"{}conjuncts\char`\"{}, chained together with A\+ND)\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item If one conjunct is of the form T1.\+A=constant, then \{\} -\/$>$ \{A\} holds in R (the value of A is \char`\"{}the constant\char`\"{} in all rows of R).
\item If one conjunct is of the form T1.\+A=T2.\+B, then \{T1.\+A\} -\/$>$ \{T2.\+B\} (and vice versa) holds in R (the value of T2.\+B is that of T1.\+A in all rows of R).
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{group__AGGREGATE__CHECKS_OUTEREQ}{}\subsubsection{Equality-\/based, in the result of an outer join}\label{group__AGGREGATE__CHECKS_OUTEREQ}
Considering the result R of TS L\+E\+FT \mbox{\hyperlink{classJOIN}{J\+O\+IN}} TW ON C. Assuming that C is a conjunction. TS is said to be the strong table, TW is said to be the weak table (the one which might be N\+U\+LL-\/complemented in the result of this join). To make this really clear, note that, if we have \char`\"{}t1 left join (t2 left join t3 on C) on D\char`\"{}\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item in the t2-\/t3 join, t2 is strong and t3 is weak.
\item in the t1-\/(t2-\/t3) join, t1 is strong, t2 is weak, t3 is weak.
\end{DoxyItemize}

If C is deterministic and one conjunct is of the form T\+W.\+A=constant or T\+W.\+A=T\+S.\+B, then D\+JS -\/$>$ \{T\+W.\+A\} holds in R, where D\+JS is the set of all columns of TS referenced by C. Proof\+: consider in R two rows r1 and r2 which have the same values of D\+JS columns. Consider r1. There are two possibilities when r1 was built from a row of TS\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item no row in TW matched the row of TS (for no row of TW has C been true)\+: so, r1 is N\+U\+LL-\/complemented for the columns of TW. Given that r2 has the same values of D\+JS columns as r1, and given that C is deterministic, it is sure that no row in TW matched when r2 was built. So r2 is also N\+U\+LL-\/complemented for the columns of TW. So r1 and r2 have the same value of T\+W.\+A (N\+U\+LL).
\item At least one row in TW matched\+: so, r1 contains real values from TW (not N\+U\+LL-\/complemented), matching C, and thus T\+W.\+A in r1 is equal to the constant or to T\+S.\+B. Following the same reasoning as above, it is sure that it is also the case for r2.
\item In conclusion, we can see that r1 and r2 always have the same value of T\+W.\+A.
\end{DoxyItemize}

If one conjunct is of the form T\+W.\+A=T\+W.\+B then \{T\+W.\+A\} -\/$>$ \{T\+W.\+B\} holds in R Proof\+: consider r1 and r2 two rows in R having the same value of T\+W.\+A. Two cases are possible\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item this value is N\+U\+LL. Then both rows are N\+U\+LL-\/complemented (if not, the value of T\+W.\+A in TW would be N\+U\+LL, which cannot match in an equality, so C is not true, which is absurd). Thus, in r1 and r2 T\+W.\+B is N\+U\+LL.
\item This value is not N\+U\+LL. Then both rows are not N\+U\+LL-\/complemented, C matched for both, so T\+W.\+B in r1/r2 is equal to T\+W.\+A in r1/r2.
\item In conclusion, r1 and r2 have the same value of T\+W.\+B.
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{group__AGGREGATE__CHECKS_WHEREEQ}{}\subsubsection{Equality-\/based, in the result of a W\+H\+E\+R\+E clause}\label{group__AGGREGATE__CHECKS_WHEREEQ}
Same rule as the result of an inner join. Additionally, the rule is extended to T1.\+A=outer\+\_\+reference, because an outer reference is a constant during one execution of this query.

Below we examine how functional dependencies in a table propagate to its containing join nest.\hypertarget{group__AGGREGATE__CHECKS_PROPAGOUTER}{}\subsubsection{Considering the result R of T\+S L\+E\+F\+T J\+O\+I\+N T\+W O\+N C.}\label{group__AGGREGATE__CHECKS_PROPAGOUTER}
All functional dependencies in TS are also functional dependencies in R. Proof\+: trivial. The same is not necessarily true for TW. Let\textquotesingle{}s define a \char`\"{}\+N\+U\+L\+L-\/friendly functional dependency\char`\"{} (N\+F\+FD) as a functional dependency between two sets A and B, which has two properties\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item A is not empty
\item if, in a row, all values of A are N\+U\+LL, then all values of B are N\+U\+LL.
\end{DoxyItemize}

All N\+F\+F\+Ds in TW are also N\+F\+F\+Ds in R. Proof\+: consider an N\+F\+FD A -\/$>$ B in TW, and r1 and r2 two rows in R having the same values of A columns. Two cases are possible\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item In r1 and r2, at least one value of A is not N\+U\+LL. Then r1 is not N\+U\+LL-\/complemented. Its values for A and B come from TW. By application of the functional dependency in TW, because values in A are equal in TW, values in B are equal in TW and thus in r1/r2.
\item In r1 and r2, all values of A are N\+U\+LL. Two cases are possible\+: i) r1 is not N\+U\+LL-\/complemented. Its values for A and B come from TW. In the row of TW values of A are all N\+U\+LL. Because the functional dependency in N\+U\+LL-\/friendly, all values of B are N\+U\+LL in the row of TW and thus in r1. ii) r1 is N\+U\+LL-\/complemented. Then all values of B in r1 are N\+U\+LL. iii) In conclusion, all values of B in r1 are N\+U\+LL. The same reasoning applies to r2. So, values of B are identical (N\+U\+LL) in r1 and r2.
\item In conclusion, values of B are identical in r1/r2, we have proved that this is a functional dependency in R, and a N\+U\+LL-\/friendly one.
\end{DoxyItemize}

The concept of an N\+F\+FD is Guilhem\textquotesingle{}s invention. It was felt it was necessary, to have easy propagation of F\+Ds from TW to R. It was preferred to the alternative, simpler rule which says that a functional dependency A-\/$>$ B in TW is also a functional dependency in R if A contains a non-\/nullable column. There are two points to note\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item the functional dependency of the simpler rule is an N\+F\+FD, so our rule is not more restrictive than the simpler one
\item this simpler rule prevents free propagation of functional dependencies through join nests, which complicates implementation and leads to rejecting queries which could be accepted. An example follows\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}SELECT T3.A
FROM T1 LEFT JOIN (T2 LEFT JOIN T3 ON  TRUE) ON  TRUE
GROUP BY T3.PK;
\end{DoxyVerb}
 This is what the simpler rule says for this query\+: In T3, T3.\+PK-\/$>$T3.\+A holds. Let R1 be the result of \char`\"{}(\+T2 L\+E\+F\+T J\+O\+I\+N T3 O\+N T\+R\+U\+E)\char`\"{}, in R1 T3.\+PK-\/$>$T3.\+A holds, by application of\+: there is a functional dependency in the weak side T3, and T3.\+PK is not nullable in T3. Let R2 be the result of \char`\"{}\+T1 L\+E\+F\+T J\+O\+I\+N (\+T2 L\+E\+F\+T J\+O\+I\+N T3 O\+N T\+R\+U\+E) O\+N T\+R\+U\+E\char`\"{}, in R2 T3.\+PK-\/$>$T3.\+A doesn\textquotesingle{}t hold anymore, because\+: it\textquotesingle{}s a dependency in the weak side (weak side is R1 here), and T3.\+PK is nullable {\itshape when seen as a column of R1} (in R1 T3.\+PK can be N\+U\+LL, if the row of T3 is actually a N\+U\+LL-\/complemented one).
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{group__AGGREGATE__CHECKS_PROPAGINNER}{}\subsubsection{Considering the result R of T1 J\+O\+I\+N T2 O\+N C.}\label{group__AGGREGATE__CHECKS_PROPAGINNER}
All \mbox{[}N\+U\+LL-\/friendly\mbox{]} functional dependencies in T1 are also \mbox{[}N\+U\+LL-\/friendly\mbox{]} functional dependencies in R. the same is true for T2. Proof\+: trivial.\hypertarget{group__AGGREGATE__CHECKS_PROPAGSUMMARY}{}\subsubsection{Summary rules for propagating F\+Ds}\label{group__AGGREGATE__CHECKS_PROPAGSUMMARY}
All N\+U\+LL-\/friendly functional dependencies propagate freely through join nests all the way up to the result of the W\+H\+E\+RE clause. The same is true for ordinary functional dependencies except if there are weak tables along the propagation path between the table where the dependency holds and the result of the W\+H\+E\+RE clause; in other words, except if the table where the dependency holds belongs to some embedding join nest which is on the weak side of an outer join.\hypertarget{group__AGGREGATE__CHECKS_NFFDS}{}\subsubsection{Which functional dependencies are N\+U\+L\+L-\/friendly}\label{group__AGGREGATE__CHECKS_NFFDS}
A key-\/based functional dependency A -\/$>$ B in the base table is N\+U\+LL-\/friendly, because, by definition, there can never be a N\+U\+LL value in any column of A.

A functional dependency A -\/$>$ B in a base table, between parametric columns A and a generated column B, is not N\+U\+LL-\/friendly; for more details, see \mbox{\hyperlink{group__AGGREGATE__CHECKS_FDVIEW}{Functional dependencies in a view or a derived table}} .

A functional dependency A-\/$>$B in the result of T1 \mbox{\hyperlink{classJOIN}{J\+O\+IN}} T2 ON C, if based on equality of two columns, is N\+U\+LL-\/friendly. Indeed, A is not empty and if there was some N\+U\+LL in A, it would not match the equality in C and thus it would not exist in the result, absurd. If the equality is rather column=constant, A is empty, the dependency is not N\+U\+LL-\/friendly. However, in our implementation, function {\ttfamily simplify\+\_\+joins()} moves inner-\/join conditions to the embedding outer-\/join nest\textquotesingle{}s join condition, or to the W\+H\+E\+RE clause. Because our analysis of functional dependencies happens after simplify\+\_\+joins(), when we analyze T1 \mbox{\hyperlink{classJOIN}{J\+O\+IN}} T2 it is guaranteed to have no condition, and this paragraph is irrelevant.

A functional dependency in the result of TS L\+E\+FT \mbox{\hyperlink{classJOIN}{J\+O\+IN}} TW ON C, if based on equality of two columns, is N\+U\+LL-\/friendly. Proof\+: let\textquotesingle{}s consider, in turn, the two types of equality-\/based functional dependencies which exist in this result R. Let r1 be a row of R.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item If C is deterministic and one conjunct is of the form T\+W.\+A=constant or T\+W.\+A=T\+S.\+B, then D\+JS -\/$>$ \{T\+W.\+A\} holds in R, where D\+JS is the set of all columns of TS referenced by C. For N\+U\+LL-\/friendliness, we need D\+JS to not be empty. Thus, we exclude the form T\+W.\+A= constant and consider only T\+W.\+A=T\+S.\+B. We suppose that in r1 D\+JS contains all N\+U\+L\+Ls. Conjunct is T\+W.\+A=T\+S.\+B then this equality is not true, so r1 is N\+U\+LL-\/complemented\+: T\+W.\+A is N\+U\+LL in r1.
\item If one conjunct is of the form T\+W.\+A=T\+W.\+B then \{T\+W.\+A\} -\/$>$ \{T\+W.\+B\} holds in R. If in r1 T\+W.\+A is N\+U\+LL, again the equality in C is not true, and T\+W.\+B is N\+U\+LL in R1.
\item In conclusion, this is N\+U\+LL-\/friendly.
\end{DoxyItemize}

A functional dependency in the result of a W\+H\+E\+RE clause, if based on equality of two columns, is N\+U\+LL-\/friendly. If based on T1.\+A=constant, it is not, as it has an empty set of source columns.

Summary\+: all functional dependencies which we have seen so far are N\+U\+LL-\/friendly, except those inferred from T\+W.\+A=constant in an outer join condition or in a W\+H\+E\+RE clause, and those about generated columns.

Thus, in the query with T1-\/T2-\/T3 previously seen, T3.\+PK-\/$>$T3.\+A is N\+U\+LL-\/friendly and propagates, query is accepted.

In our implementation, we take special care of T\+W.\+A=constant in an outer join condition\+: we infer a functional dependency D\+JS-\/$>$T\+W.\+A from such equality only if one of these requirements are met\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item the join nest \char`\"{}\+T\+S L\+E\+F\+T J\+O\+I\+N T\+W O\+N T\+W.\+A=constant \mbox{[}\+A\+N\+D...\mbox{]}\char`\"{} is not on the weak side of any embedding join nest -\/ in that case, propagation will not meet any weak tables so we do not need the dependency to be N\+U\+LL-\/friendly, it will propagate anyway.
\item D\+JS contains at least one column from a strong-\/side table which, if N\+U\+LL, makes the join condition not evaluate to T\+R\+UE -\/ in that case, D\+JS-\/$>$T\+W.\+A is N\+U\+LL-\/friendly.
\end{DoxyItemize}

Either of these two conditions is satisfied in most practical cases. For example, it\textquotesingle{}s very common to have an equality between a strong-\/side column and a weak-\/side column as a conjunct in the outer join condition (like, \char`\"{}\+O\+N
strong.\+pk = weak.\+foreign\+\_\+key A\+N\+D ...\char`\"{} or \char`\"{}\+O\+N strong.\+foreign\+\_\+key = weak.\+pk A\+N\+D
...\char`\"{}); this satisfies the second condition. It\textquotesingle{}s also common to have outer joins only left-\/deep (\char`\"{}\+S\+E\+L\+E\+C\+T ... T1 L\+E\+F\+T J\+O\+I\+N T2 O\+N ...

Note that the dependency found from T\+W.\+A=T\+S.\+B in an outer join condition always satisfies the second condition.

T1.\+A=constant in a W\+H\+E\+RE clause is exterior to any join nest so does not need to propagate, so does not need to be N\+U\+LL-\/friendly.\hypertarget{group__AGGREGATE__CHECKS_FDVIEW}{}\subsubsection{Functional dependencies in a view or a derived table}\label{group__AGGREGATE__CHECKS_FDVIEW}
In the rest of this text, we will use the term \char`\"{}view\char`\"{} for \char`\"{}view or derived
table\char`\"{}. A view can be merged or materialized, in My\+S\+QL. Consider a view V defined by a query expression. If the query expression contains U\+N\+I\+ON or R\+O\+L\+L\+UP (which is based on U\+N\+I\+ON) there are no functional dependencies in this view. So let\textquotesingle{}s assume that the query expression is a query specification (let\textquotesingle{}s note it VS)\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}CREATE VIEW V AS SELECT [DISTINCT] VE1 AS C1, VE2 AS C2, ... FROM ... WHERE ... [GROUP BY ...] [HAVING ...] [ORDER BY ...]
\end{DoxyVerb}


If \{V\+E1, V\+E2, V\+E3\} are columns of tables of the F\+R\+OM clause, and \{V\+E1, V\+E2\} -\/$>$ \{V\+E3\} has been deduced from rules in the previous sections \mbox{[}and is N\+U\+LL-\/friendly\mbox{]}, then \{C1, C2\} -\/$>$ \{ C3 \} holds in the view \mbox{[}and is N\+U\+LL-\/friendly\mbox{]}.

If \{V\+E1, V\+E2\} are columns of tables of the F\+R\+OM clause, and V\+E3 is a deterministic expression depending only on V\+E1 and V\+E2, then \{C1, C2\} -\/$>$ \{ C3 \} in the view. It is not always N\+U\+LL-\/friendly, for example\+: V\+E3 could be C\+O\+A\+L\+E\+S\+C\+E(\+V\+E1,\+V\+E2,3)\+: if V\+E1 (C1) and V\+E2 (C2) are N\+U\+LL, V\+E3 (C3) is 3\+: not N\+U\+LL. Another example\+: V\+E3 could be a literal; \{\}-\/$>$\{C3\}, the left set is empty. The same examples apply to a generated column in a base table -\/ it is like a merged view\textquotesingle{}s expression. For example, in a base table T which has a generated column C3 AS C\+O\+A\+L\+E\+S\+C\+E(\+C1,\+C2,3)\+: \{C1, C2\} -\/$>$ \{ C3 \} holds in T but is not N\+U\+LL-\/friendly.

If VS is a grouped query (which, in My\+S\+QL, implies that the view is materialized), then in the result of the grouping there is a functional dependency from the set of all group expressions to the set of all selected expressions (otherwise, this query expression would not have passed its own only\+\_\+full\+\_\+group\+\_\+by validation -\/ in the implementation we validate each query expression separately). Thus, if all group expressions of VS are in the select list of VS, for example they are V\+E1 and V\+E2, then \{C1, C2\} -\/$>$ \{V.$\ast$\}. It is not N\+U\+LL-\/friendly, for example\+: V\+E3 is C\+O\+U\+N\+T(1)\+: if the result of the W\+H\+E\+RE clause contains a row with group expressions V\+E1 and V\+E2 equal to N\+U\+LL, V\+E3 is not N\+U\+LL.

It\textquotesingle{}s possible to infer functional dependencies from equality conditions in H\+A\+V\+I\+NG, but we have not implemented it yet.

Because some functional dependencies above are not N\+U\+LL-\/friendly, they exist in the view, but may not freely propagate in the result of join nests containing the view. This includes examples just given in paragraphs above, and the case of T1.\+A=constant in the W\+H\+E\+RE clause of VS.

Thus, when we know of a functional dependency A -\/$>$ B in the query expression of a view, we deduce from it a functional dependency in the view only if\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item this view is not on the weak side of any embedding join nest (so N\+U\+LL-\/friendliness is not required for propagation).
\item or A contains at least one non-\/nullable expression, which makes A -\/$>$ B N\+U\+LL-\/friendly.
\end{DoxyItemize}

The above is fine for materialized views. For merged views, we cannot study the query expression of the view, it has been merged (and scattered), so we use a different rule\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item a merged view is similar to a join nest inserted in the parent query, so for dependencies based on keys or join conditions, we simply follow propagation rules of the non-\/view sections.
\item For expression-\/based dependencies (V\+E3 depends on V\+E1 and V\+E2, V\+E3 belonging to the view S\+E\+L\+E\+CT list), which may not be N\+U\+LL-\/friendly, we require
\item the same non-\/weak-\/side criterion as above
\item or that the left set of the dependency be non-\/empty and that if V\+E1 and V\+E2 are N\+U\+LL then V\+E3 must be N\+U\+LL, which makes the dependency N\+U\+LL-\/friendly.
\item The same solution is used for generated columns in a base table.
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{group__AGGREGATE__CHECKS_USED_TABLES}{}\subsection{Implementation note\+: used\+\_\+tables\+\_\+for\+\_\+level() vs used\+\_\+tables()}\label{group__AGGREGATE__CHECKS_USED_TABLES}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item When we are looking for items to validate, we must enter scalar/row subqueries; if we find an item of our S\+E\+L\+E\+C\+T\+\_\+\+L\+EX inside such subquery, for example an \mbox{\hyperlink{classItem__field}{Item\+\_\+field}} with depended\+\_\+from equal to our S\+E\+L\+E\+C\+T\+\_\+\+L\+EX, we must use used\+\_\+tables\+\_\+for\+\_\+level(). Example\+: when validating t1.\+a in select (select t1.\+a from t1 as t2 limit 1) from t1 group by t1.\+pk; we need t1.\+a\textquotesingle{}s map in the grouped query; used\+\_\+tables() would return O\+U\+T\+E\+R\+\_\+\+R\+E\+F\+\_\+\+T\+A\+B\+L\+E\+\_\+\+B\+IT.
\item When we are searching for F\+Ds in P\+Ks, or join conditions, or the G\+R\+O\+UP BY clause, we do not enter scalar/row subqueries, so we use used\+\_\+tables(). Example\+: select ... from t1 where t1.\+a=(subq) from t1 group by ... the subq is not used to discover F\+Ds in the grouped query. Or\+: select (select t2.\+a from t1 as t2 where t2.\+a=t1.\+a group by t2.\+b) from t1 when validating the subq, t1.\+a is an outer reference, kind of a constant, so tells us that t2.\+a is FD on \{\} ; using used\+\_\+tables\+\_\+for\+\_\+level() on t1.\+a would be nonsense -\/ we are validating the subquery.
