\subsection{Detailed Description}
An Internal\+\_\+error\+\_\+handler that suppresses errors regarding views\textquotesingle{} underlying tables that occur during privilege checking. It hides errors which show view underlying table information. This happens in the cases when


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item A view\textquotesingle{}s underlying table (e.\+g. referenced in its S\+E\+L\+E\+CT list) does not exist or columns of underlying table are altered. There should not be an error as no attempt was made to access it per se.
\item Access is denied for some table, column, function or stored procedure such as mentioned above. This error gets raised automatically, since we can\textquotesingle{}t untangle its access checking from that of the view itself.

There are currently two mechanisms at work that handle errors for views based on an Internal\+\_\+error\+\_\+handler. This one and another one is \mbox{\hyperlink{classShow__create__error__handler}{Show\+\_\+create\+\_\+error\+\_\+handler}}. The latter handles errors encountered during execution of S\+H\+OW C\+R\+E\+A\+TE V\+I\+EW, while this mechanism using this method is handles S\+E\+L\+E\+CT from views. The two methods should not clash.
